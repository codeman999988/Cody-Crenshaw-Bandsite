This project is BANDSITE.  It utilizes mockups and provided assets to recreate a band's website.  It is being built in three distinct "sprints" and will be completed once the third sprint is complete.

The current version of the site is the sprint two version.

The site currently has limited functionality.  It has a comments section on the index page that is populated with Javascript and can add comments to the page.  It has a shows section on the show page that is populated with Javascript.  More dynamism will be added to this project in sprint three.
